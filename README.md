## Overview

HMK Clinic fosters easy accessibility to medical care and creates awareness about undiscovered diseases in rural areas of Nigeria through an automated dial number system. Built using Python, Africa's Talking API, and PythonAnywhere, our solution bridges the healthcare gap for underserved communities.

## The Problem

Rural areas in Nigeria face significant challenges in accessing quality healthcare:

- Limited access to medical facilities leads to unnecessary travel expenses and time waste
- Lack of awareness about diseases results in delayed diagnosis and preventable complications
- Insufficient medical infrastructure causes waste of healthcare resources and strain on existing systems

## Our Solution

HMK Clinic provides an automated dial number system that:

- Offers 24/7 access to medical care for rural communities
- Increases awareness about undiscovered diseases
- Improves healthcare accessibility for underserved populations
- Works without internet connectivity
- Delivers instant medical assistance via phone

## Key Features

1. **Remote Medical Care**: Receive medical assistance from home
2. **Simple Access**: Just dial a number for instant help
3. **Early Detection**: Uncover unknown diseases at early stages
4. **No Internet Required**: Works with basic phone service
5. **Automated Service**: Easy communication through automated system

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Africa's Talking API
- PythonAnywhere

## Business Model

- **Grants**: Funding from government agencies and charitable donations
- **Advertisements**: Revenue from selling advertising slots on the dial code

## Key Metrics
